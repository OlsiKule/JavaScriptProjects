        Make Code More Reusable with the this Keyword

The last challenge introduced a method to the duck object. It used duck.name dot notation to access the value for the name property within the return statement:

sayName: function() {return "The name of this duck is " + duck.name + ".";}

While this is a valid way to access the object's property, there is a pitfall here. If the variable name changes, any code referencing the original name would need to be updated as well. In a short object definition, it isn't a problem, but if an object has many references to its properties there is a greater chance for error.

A way to avoid these issues is with the this keyword:

let duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2,
  sayName: function() {return "The name of this duck is " + this.name + ".";}
};

this is a deep topic, and the above example is only one way to use it. In the current context, this refers to the object that the method is associated with: duck. If the object's name is changed to mallard, it is not necessary to find all the references to duck in the code. It makes the code reusable and easier to read.

Modify the dog.sayLegs method to remove any references to dog. Use the duck example for guidance.
Tests

Waiting: dog.sayLegs() should return the given string.
Waiting: Your code should use the this keyword to access the numLegs property of dog.
        */ 

        let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4,
  sayLegs: function() {return "This dog has " + this.numLegs + " legs.";}
};

console.log(dog.sayLegs());


/*
Define a Constructor Function

Constructors are functions that create new objects. They define properties and behaviors that will belong to the new object. Think of them as a blueprint for the creation of new objects.

Here is an example of a constructor:

function Bird() {
  this.name = "Albert";
  this.color = "blue";
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

This constructor defines a Bird object with properties name, color, and numLegs set to Albert, blue, and 2, respectively. Constructors follow a few conventions:

    Constructors are defined with a capitalized name to distinguish them from other functions that are not constructors.
    Constructors use the keyword this to set properties of the object they will create. Inside the constructor, this refers to the new object it will create.
    Constructors define properties and behaviors instead of returning a value as other functions might.

Create a constructor, Dog, with properties name, color, and numLegs that are set to a string, a string, and a number, respectively.
Tests

Passed: Dog should have a name property set to a string.
Passed: Dog should have a color property set to a string.
Passed: Dog should have a numLegs property set to a number.
*/ 

function Dog() {
  this.name = "doggo";
  this.color = "golden retriever";
  this.numLegs = 4;
}

/*
Use a Constructor to Create Objects

Here's the Bird constructor from the previous challenge:

function Bird() {
  this.name = "Albert";
  this.color  = "blue";
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let blueBird = new Bird();

NOTE: this inside the constructor always refers to the object being created.

Notice that the new operator is used when calling a constructor. This tells JavaScript to create a new instance of Bird called blueBird. Without the new operator, this inside the constructor would not point to the newly created object, giving unexpected results. Now blueBird has all the properties defined inside the Bird constructor:

blueBird.name;
blueBird.color;
blueBird.numLegs;

Just like any other object, its properties can be accessed and modified:

blueBird.name = 'Elvira';
blueBird.name;

Use the Dog constructor from the last lesson to create a new instance of Dog, assigning it to a variable hound.
Tests

Passed: hound should be created using the Dog constructor.
Passed: Your code should use the new operator to create an instance of Dog.
*/ 

function Dog() {
  this.name = "Rupert";
  this.color = "brown";
  this.numLegs = 4;
}
// Only change code below this line

let hound = new Dog();
// hound.name = "Scooby";
// console.log(hound.name)


/*
Extend Constructors to Receive Arguments

The Bird and Dog constructors from the last challenge worked well. However, notice that all Birds that are created with the Bird constructor are automatically named Albert, are blue in color, and have two legs. What if you want birds with different values for name and color? It's possible to change the properties of each bird manually but that would be a lot of work:

let swan = new Bird();
swan.name = "Carlos";
swan.color = "white";

Suppose you were writing a program to keep track of hundreds or even thousands of different birds in an aviary. It would take a lot of time to create all the birds, then change the properties to different values for every one. To more easily create different Bird objects, you can design your Bird constructor to accept parameters:

function Bird(name, color) {
  this.name = name;
  this.color = color;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

Then pass in the values as arguments to define each unique bird into the Bird constructor: let cardinal = new Bird("Bruce", "red"); This gives a new instance of Bird with name and color properties set to Bruce and red, respectively. The numLegs property is still set to 2. The cardinal has these properties:

cardinal.name
cardinal.color
cardinal.numLegs

The constructor is more flexible. It's now possible to define the properties for each Bird at the time it is created, which is one way that JavaScript constructors are so useful. They group objects together based on shared characteristics and behavior and define a blueprint that automates their creation.

Create another Dog constructor. This time, set it up to take the parameters name and color, and have the property numLegs fixed at 4. Then create a new Dog saved in a variable terrier. Pass it two strings as arguments for the name and color properties.
Tests

Passed: Dog should receive an argument for name.
Passed: Dog should receive an argument for color.
Passed: Dog should have property numLegs set to 4.
Passed: terrier should be created using the Dog constructor.
*/ 

function Dog(name, color) {
this.name = name;
this.color = color; 
this.numLegs = 4;
}

let terrier = new Dog("wooffy", "brown");
console.log(terrier.name);
console.log(terrier.color);
console.log(terrier.numLegs);



/*
Verify an Object's Constructor with instanceof

Anytime a constructor function creates a new object, that object is said to be an instance of its constructor. JavaScript gives a convenient way to verify this with the instanceof operator. instanceof allows you to compare an object to a constructor, returning true or false based on whether or not that object was created with the constructor. Here's an example:

let Bird = function(name, color) {
  this.name = name;
  this.color = color;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let crow = new Bird("Alexis", "black");

crow instanceof Bird;

This instanceof method would return true.

If an object is created without using a constructor, instanceof will verify that it is not an instance of that constructor:

let canary = {
  name: "Mildred",
  color: "Yellow",
  numLegs: 2
};

canary instanceof Bird;

This instanceof method would return false.

Create a new instance of the House constructor, calling it myHouse and passing a number of bedrooms. Then, use instanceof to verify that it is an instance of House.
Tests

Passed: myHouse should have a numBedrooms attribute set to a number.
Passed: You should verify that myHouse is an instance of House using the instanceof operator.
*/ 

function House(numBedrooms) {
  this.numBedrooms = numBedrooms;
}

// Only change code below this line
let myHouse = new House (3);

myHouse instanceof House;
// console.log(myHouse.numBedrooms)

/*
Understand Own Properties

In the following example, the Bird constructor defines two properties: name and numLegs:

function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let duck = new Bird("Donald");
let canary = new Bird("Tweety");

name and numLegs are called own properties, because they are defined directly on the instance object. That means that duck and canary each has its own separate copy of these properties. In fact every instance of Bird will have its own copy of these properties. The following code adds all of the own properties of duck to the array ownProps:

let ownProps = [];

for (let property in duck) {
  if(duck.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
    ownProps.push(property);
  }
}

console.log(ownProps);

The console would display the value ["name", "numLegs"].

Add the own properties of canary to the array ownProps.
Tests

Passed: ownProps should include the values numLegs and name.
Passed: You should solve this challenge without using the built in method Object.keys().
Passed: You should solve this challenge without hardcoding the ownProps array.
*/ 

function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let canary = new Bird("Tweety");
let ownProps = [];
// Only change code below this line
for (let property in canary){
  if (canary.hasOwnProperty(property)){
    ownProps.push(property)
  }
}
console.log(ownProps)


/*
Use Prototype Properties to Reduce Duplicate Code

Since numLegs will probably have the same value for all instances of Bird, you essentially have a duplicated variable numLegs inside each Bird instance.

This may not be an issue when there are only two instances, but imagine if there are millions of instances. That would be a lot of duplicated variables.

A better way is to use the prototype of Bird. Properties in the prototype are shared among ALL instances of Bird. Here's how to add numLegs to the Bird prototype:

Bird.prototype.numLegs = 2;

Now all instances of Bird have the numLegs property.

console.log(duck.numLegs);
console.log(canary.numLegs);

Since all instances automatically have the properties on the prototype, think of a prototype as a "recipe" for creating objects. Note that the prototype for duck and canary is part of the Bird constructor as Bird.prototype. Nearly every object in JavaScript has a prototype property which is part of the constructor function that created it.

Add a numLegs property to the prototype of Dog
Tests

Passed: beagle should have a numLegs property.
Passed: beagle.numLegs should be a number.
Passed: numLegs should be a prototype property not an own property.
*/ 

function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Dog.prototype.numLegs = 5;

// Only change code above this line
let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");
console.log(beagle.numLegs)
