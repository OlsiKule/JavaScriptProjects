    In the game of Golf, each hole has a par, meaning, the average number of strokes a golfer is expected to make in order to sink the ball in the hole to complete the play. Depending on how far above or below par your strokes are, there is a different nickname.
    
    Your function will be passed par and strokes arguments. Return the correct string according to this table which lists the strokes in order of priority; top (highest) to bottom (lowest):
    Strokes	Return
    1	"Hole-in-one!"
    <= par - 2	"Eagle"
    par - 1	"Birdie"
    par	"Par"
    par + 1	"Bogey"
    par + 2	"Double Bogey"
    >= par + 3	"Go Home!"
    
    par and strokes will always be numeric and positive. We have added an array of all the names for your convenience.

/*
In a switch statement you may not be able to specify all possible values as case statements. Instead, you can add the default statement which will be executed if no matching case statements are found. Think of it like the final else statement in an if/else chain.

A default statement should be the last case.

switch (num) {
  case value1:
    statement1;
    break;
  case value2:
    statement2;
    break;
...
  default:
    defaultStatement;
    break;
}

Write a switch statement to set answer for the following conditions:
a - apple
b - bird
c - cat
default - stuff
*/ 
function switchOfStuff(val) {
  let answer = "";
  // Only change code below this line
switch (val){
  case "a": 
    answer = "apple";
    break;
  case "b": 
    answer = "bird";
    break;
  case "c": 
    answer = "cat";
    break;
  default: 
    answer = "stuff";
    break;
}
  // Only change code above this line
  return answer;
}

switchOfStuff(1);


/*
Multiple Identical Options in Switch Statements

If the break statement is omitted from a switch statement's case, the following case statement(s) are executed until a break is encountered. If you have multiple inputs with the same output, you can represent them in a switch statement like this:

let result = "";
switch (val) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
  case 3:
    result = "1, 2, or 3";
    break;
  case 4:
    result = "4 alone";
}

Cases for 1, 2, and 3 will all produce the same result.

Write a switch statement to set answer for the following ranges:
1-3 - Low
4-6 - Mid
7-9 - High

Note: You will need to have a case statement for each number in the range.
*/ 

function sequentialSizes(val) {
  let answer = "";
  // Only change code below this line
switch (val){
  case 1:
  case 2:
  case 3:
    answer = "Low"
    break;
  case 4:
  case 5: 
  case 6:
    answer = "Mid"
    break;
  case 7:
  case 8:
  case 9:
    answer = "High" 
}
  // Only change code above this line
  return answer;
}

 Counting Cards

In the casino game Blackjack, a player can determine whether they have an advantage on the next hand over the house by keeping track of the relative number of high and low cards remaining in the deck. This is called Card Counting.

Having more high cards remaining in the deck favors the player. Each card is assigned a value according to the table below. When the count is positive, the player should bet high. When the count is zero or negative, the player should bet low.
Count Change	Cards
+1	2, 3, 4, 5, 6
0	7, 8, 9
-1	10, 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'

You will write a card counting function. It will receive a card parameter, which can be a number or a string, and increment or decrement the global count variable according to the card's value (see table). The function will then return a string with the current count and the string Bet if the count is positive, or Hold if the count is zero or negative. The current count and the player's decision (Bet or Hold) should be separated by a single space.

Example Outputs: -3 Hold or 5 Bet

Hint
Do NOT reset count to 0 when value is 7, 8, or 9.
Do NOT return an array.
Do NOT include quotes (single or double) in the output.
Tests

Passed: Your function should return a value for count and the text (Bet or Hold) with one space character between them.
Passed: Cards Sequence 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 should return the string 5 Bet
Passed: Cards Sequence 7, 8, 9 should return the string 0 Hold
Passed: Cards Sequence 10, J, Q, K, A should return the string -5 Hold
Passed: Cards Sequence 3, 7, Q, 8, A should return the string -1 Hold
Passed: Cards Sequence 2, J, 9, 2, 7 should return the string 1 Bet
Passed: Cards Sequence 2, 2, 10 should return the string 1 Bet
Passed: Cards Sequence 3, 2, A, 10, K should return the string -1 Hold
