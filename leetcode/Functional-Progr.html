        Learn About Functional Programming

Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope: INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT

Functional programming is about:

    Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change

    Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output

    Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled

The members of freeCodeCamp happen to love tea.

In the code editor, the prepareTea and getTea functions are already defined for you. Call the getTea function to get 40 cups of tea for the team, and store them in the tea4TeamFCC variable.
Tests

Passed: The tea4TeamFCC variable should hold 40 cups of tea for the team.
Passed: The tea4TeamFCC variable should hold cups of green tea.
*/ 


// Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea
const prepareTea = () => 'greenTea';

/*
Given a function (representing the tea type) and number of cups needed, the
following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of
a specific type of tea).
*/
const getsTea = (numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];

  for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }
  return teaCups;
};

/*
Understand Functional Programming Terminology

The FCC Team had a mood swing and now wants two types of tea: green tea and black tea. General Fact: Client mood swings are pretty common.

With that information, we'll need to revisit the getTea function from last challenge to handle various tea requests. We can modify getTea to accept a function as a parameter to be able to change the type of tea it prepares. This makes getTea more flexible, and gives the programmer more control when client requests change.

But first, let's cover some functional terminology:

Callbacks are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function. You may have seen them passed to other methods, for example in filter, the callback function tells JavaScript the criteria for how to filter an array.

Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called first class functions. In JavaScript, all functions are first class functions.

The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value, are called higher order functions.

When functions are passed in to or returned from another function, then those functions which were passed in or returned can be called a lambda.

Prepare 27 cups of green tea and 13 cups of black tea and store them in tea4GreenTeamFCC and tea4BlackTeamFCC variables, respectively. Note that the getTea function has been modified so it now takes a function as the first argument.

Note: The data (the number of cups of tea) is supplied as the last argument. We'll discuss this more in later lessons.
Tests

Passed: The tea4GreenTeamFCC variable should hold 27 cups of green tea for the team.
Passed: The tea4GreenTeamFCC variable should hold cups of green tea.
Passed: The tea4BlackTeamFCC variable should hold 13 cups of black tea.

    Passed: The tea4BlackTeamFCC variable should hold cups of black tea.

Understand the Hazards of Using Imperative Code

Functional programming is a good habit. It keeps your code easy to manage, and saves you from sneaky bugs. But before we get there, let's look at an imperative approach to programming to highlight where you may have issues.

In English (and many other languages), the imperative tense is used to give commands. Similarly, an imperative style in programming is one that gives the computer a set of statements to perform a task.

Often the statements change the state of the program, like updating global variables. A classic example is writing a for loop that gives exact directions to iterate over the indices of an array.

In contrast, functional programming is a form of declarative programming. You tell the computer what you want done by calling a method or function.

JavaScript offers many predefined methods that handle common tasks so you don't need to write out how the computer should perform them. For example, instead of using the for loop mentioned above, you could call the map method which handles the details of iterating over an array. This helps to avoid semantic errors, like the "Off By One Errors" that were covered in the Debugging section.

Consider the scenario: you are browsing the web in your browser, and want to track the tabs you have opened. Let's try to model this using some simple object-oriented code.

A Window object is made up of tabs, and you usually have more than one Window open. The titles of each open site in each Window object is held in an array. After working in the browser (opening new tabs, merging windows, and closing tabs), you want to print the tabs that are still open. Closed tabs are removed from the array and new tabs (for simplicity) get added to the end of it.

The code editor shows an implementation of this functionality with functions for tabOpen(), tabClose(), and join(). The array tabs is part of the Window object that stores the name of the open pages.

Examine the code in the editor. It's using a method that has side effects in the program, causing incorrect behaviour. The final list of open tabs, stored in finalTabs.tabs, should be ['FB', 'Gitter', 'Reddit', 'Twitter', 'Medium', 'new tab', 'Netflix', 'YouTube', 'Vine', 'GMail', 'Work mail', 'Docs', 'freeCodeCamp', 'new tab'] but the list produced by the code is slightly different.

Change Window.prototype.tabClose so that it removes the correct tab.
Tests

Passed: finalTabs.tabs should be ['FB', 'Gitter', 'Reddit', 'Twitter', 'Medium', 'new tab', 'Netflix', 'YouTube', 'Vine', 'GMail', 'Work mail', 'Docs', 'freeCodeCamp', 'new tab']

*/ 



// tabs is an array of titles of each site open within the window
const Window = function(tabs) {
  this.tabs = tabs; // We keep a record of the array inside the object
};

// When you join two windows into one window
Window.prototype.join = function(otherWindow) {
  this.tabs = this.tabs.concat(otherWindow.tabs);
  return this;
};

// When you open a new tab at the end
Window.prototype.tabOpen = function(tab) {
  this.tabs.push('new tab'); // Let's open a new tab for now
  return this;
};

// When you close a tab
Window.prototype.tabClose = function(index) {

  // Only change code below this line

  const tabsBeforeIndex = this.tabs.slice(0, index); // Get the tabs before the tab
  const tabsAfterIndex = this.tabs.slice(index + 1); // Get the tabs after the tab

  this.tabs = tabsBeforeIndex.concat(tabsAfterIndex); // Join them together

  // Only change code above this line

  return this;
 };

// Let's create three browser windows
const workWindow = new Window(['GMail', 'Inbox', 'Work mail', 'Docs', 'freeCodeCamp']); // Your mailbox, drive, and other work sites
const socialWindow = new Window(['FB', 'Gitter', 'Reddit', 'Twitter', 'Medium']); // Social sites
const videoWindow = new Window(['Netflix', 'YouTube', 'Vimeo', 'Vine']); // Entertainment sites

// Now perform the tab opening, closing, and other operations
const finalTabs = socialWindow
  .tabOpen() // Open a new tab for cat memes
  .join(videoWindow.tabClose(2)) // Close third tab in video window, and join
  .join(workWindow.tabClose(1).tabOpen());
console.log(finalTabs.tabs.length);
console.log(finalTabs.tabs);



/*
Avoid Mutations and Side Effects Using Functional Programming

If you haven't already figured it out, the issue in the previous challenge was with the splice call in the tabClose() function. Unfortunately, splice changes the original array it is called on, so the second call to it used a modified array, and gave unexpected results.

This is a small example of a much larger pattern - you call a function on a variable, array, or an object, and the function changes the variable or something in the object.

One of the core principles of functional programming is to not change things. Changes lead to bugs. It's easier to prevent bugs knowing that your functions don't change anything, including the function arguments or any global variable.

The previous example didn't have any complicated operations but the splice method changed the original array, and resulted in a bug.

Recall that in functional programming, changing or altering things is called mutation, and the outcome is called a side effect. A function, ideally, should be a pure function, meaning that it does not cause any side effects.

Let's try to master this discipline and not alter any variable or object in our code.

Fill in the code for the function incrementer so it returns the value of the global variable fixedValue increased by one.
Tests

Passed: Your function incrementer should not change the value of fixedValue (which is 4).
Passed: Your incrementer function should return a value that is one larger than the fixedValue value.
Passed: Your incrementer function should return a value based on the global fixedValue variable value.
*/ 

// The global variable
let fixValue = 4;
function incrementer() {
  // Only change code below this line
  return fixValue + 1
  // Only change code above this line
}


/*
Pass Arguments to Avoid External Dependence in a Function

The last challenge was a step closer to functional programming principles, but there is still something missing.

We didn't alter the global variable value, but the function incrementer would not work without the global variable fixedValue being there.

Another principle of functional programming is to always declare your dependencies explicitly. This means if a function depends on a variable or object being present, then pass that variable or object directly into the function as an argument.

There are several good consequences from this principle. The function is easier to test, you know exactly what input it takes, and it won't depend on anything else in your program.

This can give you more confidence when you alter, remove, or add new code. You would know what you can or cannot change and you can see where the potential traps are.

Finally, the function would always produce the same output for the same set of inputs, no matter what part of the code executes it.

Let's update the incrementer function to clearly declare its dependencies.

Write the incrementer function so it takes an argument, and then returns a result after increasing the value by one.
Tests

Passed: Your function incrementer should not change the value of fixedValue (which is 4).
Passed: Your incrementer function should take an argument.
Passed: Your incrementer function should return a value that is one larger than the fixedValue value.
*/ 

// The global variable
let fixedValue = 4;

// Only change code below this line
function incrementer(num) {
  return num + 1;
  // Only change code above this line
}


/*
Refactor Global Variables Out of Functions

So far, we have seen two distinct principles for functional programming:

    Don't alter a variable or object - create new variables and objects and return them if need be from a function. Hint: using something like const newArr = arrVar, where arrVar is an array will simply create a reference to the existing variable and not a copy. So changing a value in newArr would change the value in arrVar.

    Declare function parameters - any computation inside a function depends only on the arguments passed to the function, and not on any global object or variable.

Adding one to a number is not very exciting, but we can apply these principles when working with arrays or more complex objects.

Rewrite the code so the global array bookList is not changed inside either function. The add function should add the given bookName to the end of the array passed to it and return a new array (list). The remove function should remove the given bookName from the array passed to it.

Note: Both functions should return an array, and any new parameters should be added before the bookName parameter.
Tests

Passed: bookList should not change and still equal ["The Hound of the Baskervilles", "On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies", "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae"].
Failed: add(bookList, "A Brief History of Time") should return ["The Hound of the Baskervilles", "On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies", "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae", "A Brief History of Time"].

/*
Use the map Method to Extract Data from an Array

So far we have learned to use pure functions to avoid side effects in a program. Also, we have seen the value in having a function only depend on its input arguments.

This is only the beginning. As its name suggests, functional programming is centered around a theory of functions.

It would make sense to be able to pass them as arguments to other functions, and return a function from another function. Functions are considered first class objects in JavaScript, which means they can be used like any other object. They can be saved in variables, stored in an object, or passed as function arguments.

Let's start with some simple array functions, which are methods on the array object prototype. In this exercise we are looking at Array.prototype.map(), or more simply map.

The map method iterates over each item in an array and returns a new array containing the results of calling the callback function on each element. It does this without mutating the original array.

When the callback is used, it is passed three arguments. The first argument is the current element being processed. The second is the index of that element and the third is the array upon which the map method was called.

See below for an example using the map method on the users array to return a new array containing only the names of the users as elements. For simplicity, the example only uses the first argument of the callback.

const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const names = users.map(user => user.name);
console.log(names);

The console would display the value [ 'John', 'Amy', 'camperCat' ].

The watchList array holds objects with information on several movies. Use map on watchList to assign a new array of objects to the ratings variable. Each movie in the new array should have only a title key with the name of the film, and a rating key with the IMDB rating. The code in the editor currently uses a for loop to do this, so you should replace the loop functionality with your map expression.
Tests

Passed: The watchList variable should not change.
Passed: Your code should not use a for loop.
Passed: Your code should use the map method.
Passed: ratings should equal [{"title": "Inception", "rating": "8.8"}, {"title": "Interstellar", "rating": "8.6"}, {"title": "The Dark Knight", "rating": "9.0"},{"title": "Batman Begins", "rating": "8.3"}, {"title": "Avatar", "rating": "7.9"}].

/*
Implement map on a Prototype

As you have seen from applying Array.prototype.map(), or simply map() earlier, the map method returns an array of the same length as the one it was called on. It also doesn't alter the original array, as long as its callback function doesn't.

In other words, map is a pure function, and its output depends solely on its inputs. Plus, it takes another function as its argument.

You might learn a lot about the map method if you implement your own version of it. It is recommended you use a for loop or Array.prototype.forEach().

Write your own Array.prototype.myMap(), which should behave exactly like Array.prototype.map(). You should not use the built-in map method. The Array instance can be accessed in the myMap method using this.
Tests

Passed: [23, 65, 98, 5, 13].myMap(item => item * 2) should equal [46, 130, 196, 10, 26].
Passed: ["naomi", "quincy", "camperbot"].myMap(element => element.toUpperCase()) should return ["NAOMI", "QUINCY", "CAMPERBOT"].
Passed: [1, 1, 2, 5, 2].myMap((element, index, array) => array[index + 1] || array[0]) should return [1, 2, 5, 2, 1].
Passed: Your code should not use the map method.

/*
Use the filter Method to Extract Data from an Array

Another useful array function is Array.prototype.filter(), or simply filter().

filter calls a function on each element of an array and returns a new array containing only the elements for which that function returns a truthy value - that is, a value which returns true if passed to the Boolean() constructor. In other words, it filters the array, based on the function passed to it. Like map, it does this without needing to modify the original array.

The callback function accepts three arguments. The first argument is the current element being processed. The second is the index of that element and the third is the array upon which the filter method was called.

See below for an example using the filter method on the users array to return a new array containing only the users under the age of 30. For simplicity, the example only uses the first argument of the callback.

const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const usersUnder30 = users.filter(user => user.age < 30);

Implement the filter Method on a Prototype

You might learn a lot about the filter method if you implement your own version of it. It is recommended you use a for loop or Array.prototype.forEach().

Write your own Array.prototype.myFilter(), which should behave exactly like Array.prototype.filter(). You should not use the built-in filter method. The Array instance can be accessed in the myFilter method using this.

/*
Return Part of an Array Using the slice Method

The slice method returns a copy of certain elements of an array. It can take two arguments, the first gives the index of where to begin the slice, the second is the index for where to end the slice (and it's non-inclusive). If the arguments are not provided, the default is to start at the beginning of the array through the end, which is an easy way to make a copy of the entire array. The slice method does not mutate the original array, but returns a new one.

Here's an example:

const arr = ["Cat", "Dog", "Tiger", "Zebra"];
const newArray = arr.slice(1, 3);

newArray would have the value ["Dog", "Tiger"].

Use the slice method in the sliceArray function to return part of the anim array given the provided beginSlice and endSlice indices. The function should return an array.
Tests

Passed: Your code should use the slice method.
Passed: The inputAnim variable should not change.
Passed: sliceArray(["Cat", "Dog", "Tiger", "Zebra", "Ant"], 1, 3) should return ["Dog", "Tiger"].
Passed: sliceArray(["Cat", "Dog", "Tiger", "Zebra", "Ant"], 0, 1) should return ["Cat"].
Passed: sliceArray(["Cat", "Dog", "Tiger", "Zebra", "Ant"], 1, 4) should return ["Dog", "Tiger", "Zebra"].

/*
Remove Elements from an Array Using slice Instead of splice

A common pattern while working with arrays is when you want to remove items and keep the rest of the array. JavaScript offers the splice method for this, which takes arguments for the index of where to start removing items, then the number of items to remove. If the second argument is not provided, the default is to remove items through the end. However, the splice method mutates the original array it is called on. Here's an example:

const cities = ["Chicago", "Delhi", "Islamabad", "London", "Berlin"];
cities.splice(3, 1);

Here splice returns the string London and deletes it from the cities array. cities will have the value ["Chicago", "Delhi", "Islamabad", "Berlin"].

As we saw in the last challenge, the slice method does not mutate the original array, but returns a new one which can be saved into a variable. Recall that the slice method takes two arguments for the indices to begin and end the slice (the end is non-inclusive), and returns those items in a new array. Using the slice method instead of splice helps to avoid any array-mutating side effects.

Rewrite the function nonMutatingSplice by using slice instead of splice. It should limit the provided cities array to a length of 3, and return a new array with only the first three items.

Do not mutate the original array provided to the function.
Tests

Passed: Your code should use the slice method.
Passed: Your code should not use the splice method.
Passed: The inputCities array should not change.
Passed: nonMutatingSplice(["Chicago", "Delhi", "Islamabad", "London", "Berlin"]) should return ["Chicago", "Delhi", "Islamabad"].
*/ 

function nonMutatingSplice(cities) {
  // Only change code below this line
  return cities.slice(0, 3);
  // Only change code above this line
}

const inputCities = ["Chicago", "Delhi", "Islamabad", "London", "Berlin"];
nonMutatingSplice(inputCities);


/*
Use the reduce Method to Analyze Data

Array.prototype.reduce(), or simply reduce(), is the most general of all array operations in JavaScript. You can solve almost any array processing problem using the reduce method.

The reduce method allows for more general forms of array processing, and it's possible to show that both filter and map can be derived as special applications of reduce. The reduce method iterates over each item in an array and returns a single value (i.e. string, number, object, array). This is achieved via a callback function that is called on each iteration.

The callback function accepts four arguments. The first argument is known as the accumulator, which gets assigned the return value of the callback function from the previous iteration, the second is the current element being processed, the third is the index of that element and the fourth is the array upon which reduce is called.

In addition to the callback function, reduce has an additional parameter which takes an initial value for the accumulator. If this second parameter is not used, then the first iteration is skipped and the second iteration gets passed the first element of the array as the accumulator.

See below for an example using reduce on the users array to return the sum of all the users' ages. For simplicity, the example only uses the first and second arguments.

const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const sumOfAges = users.reduce((sum, user) => sum + user.age, 0);
console.log(sumOfAges);

The console would display the value 64.

In another example, see how an object can be returned containing the names of the users as properties with their ages as values.

const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const usersObj = users.reduce((obj, user) => {
  obj[user.name] = user.age;
  return obj;
}, {});
console.log(usersObj);

The console would display the value { John: 34, Amy: 20, camperCat: 10 }.

The variable watchList holds an array of objects with information on several movies. Use reduce to find the average IMDB rating of the movies directed by Christopher Nolan. Recall from prior challenges how to filter data and map over it to pull what you need. You may need to create other variables, and return the average rating from getRating function. Note that the rating values are saved as strings in the object and need to be converted into numbers before they are used in any mathematical operations.
Tests

Passed: The watchList variable should not change.
Passed: Your code should use the reduce method.
Passed: The getRating(watchList) should equal 8.675.
Passed: Your code should not use a for loop.
Passed: Your code should return the correct output after modifying the watchList object.

Use Higher-Order Functions map, filter, or reduce to Solve a Complex Problem

Now that you have worked through a few challenges using higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and reduce(), you now get to apply them to solve a more complex challenge.

Complete the code for the squareList function using any combination of map(), filter(), and reduce(). The function should return a new array containing the squares of only the positive integers (decimal numbers are not integers) when an array of real numbers is passed to it. An example of an array of real numbers is [-3, 4.8, 5, 3, -3.2].

Note: Your function should not use any kind of for or while loops or the forEach() function.
Tests

Passed: squareList should be a function.
Passed: for, while, and forEach should not be used.
Passed: map, filter, or reduce should be used.
Passed: The function should return an array.
Passed: squareList([4, 5.6, -9.8, 3.14, 42, 6, 8.34, -2]) should return [16, 1764, 36].
Passed: squareList([-3.7, -5, 3, 10, 12.5, 7, -4.5, -17, 0.3]) should return [9, 100, 49].

/*
Sort an Array Alphabetically using the sort Method

The sort method sorts the elements of an array according to the callback function.

For example:

function ascendingOrder(arr) {
  return arr.sort(function(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  });
}

ascendingOrder([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]);

This would return the value [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

function reverseAlpha(arr) {
  return arr.sort(function(a, b) {
    return a === b ? 0 : a < b ? 1 : -1;
  });
}

reverseAlpha(['l', 'h', 'z', 'b', 's']);

This would return the value ['z', 's', 'l', 'h', 'b'].

JavaScript's default sorting method is by string Unicode point value, which may return unexpected results. Therefore, it is encouraged to provide a callback function to specify how to sort the array items. When such a callback function, normally called compareFunction, is supplied, the array elements are sorted according to the return value of the compareFunction: If compareFunction(a,b) returns a value less than 0 for two elements a and b, then a will come before b. If compareFunction(a,b) returns a value greater than 0 for two elements a and b, then b will come before a. If compareFunction(a,b) returns a value equal to 0 for two elements a and b, then a and b will remain unchanged.

Use the sort method in the alphabeticalOrder function to sort the elements of arr in alphabetical order. The function should return the sorted array.

/*
Return a Sorted Array Without Changing the Original Array

A side effect of the sort method is that it changes the order of the elements in the original array. In other words, it mutates the array in place. One way to avoid this is to first concatenate an empty array to the one being sorted (remember that slice and concat return a new array), then run the sort method.

Use the sort method in the nonMutatingSort function to sort the elements of an array in ascending order. The function should return a new array, and not mutate the globalArray variable.
Tests

Passed: Your code should use the sort method.
Passed: The globalArray variable should not change.
Passed: nonMutatingSort(globalArray) should return [2, 3, 5, 6, 9].
Passed: nonMutatingSort(globalArray) should not be hard coded.
Passed: The function should return a new array, not the array passed to it.
Passed: nonMutatingSort([1, 30, 4, 21, 100000]) should return [1, 4, 21, 30, 100000].
Passed: nonMutatingSort([140000, 104, 99]) should return [99, 104, 140000].
